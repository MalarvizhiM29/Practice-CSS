<p>There are various CSS properties that can be used to control lists.
Lists can be classified as ordered lists and unordered lists.
In ordered lists, marking of the list items is with alphabet and numbers, whereas in unordered lists, the list items are marked using bullets.
We can style the lists using CSS.</p>
